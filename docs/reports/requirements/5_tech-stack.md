# Tech Stack

Section 5 of the Requirements Report

Identify the tech stack you plan to use. If this is the tech stack required by your client, then state that in the document. If your client is flexible, you must indicate a clear rationale of the choice made. This means an extra page with a table of at least 3 options and document all pros and cons for each before letting your client make a choice.
